        <h1>Project in the console</h1>
        <p>Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE. To set it up you need to donload it and then make a folder and put a file called index.html and start coding.</p>
        <p>A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard. It is a rudimentary interface in which the monitor provides the output and the keyboard is used for input. While any computer with a monitor and keyboard may be considered a console, the term most often refers to a system used to control one or more servers. To open it you right click and press inspect. Then you press console on the top and then you are in the console.</p>
